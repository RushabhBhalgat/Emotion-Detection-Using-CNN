# Emotion-Detection-Using-CNN

This is a First Year Engineering Project. It focuses on developing an emotion detection system using Python, along with the libraries Keras, NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, Kaggle, and TensorFlow. The system aims to accurately analyze and classify emotions from input data, such as facial images or video streams, employing deep learning techniques and computer vision algorithms.
